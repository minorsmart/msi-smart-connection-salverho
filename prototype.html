<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the main goals of the project is designing and building a device to catch bees in a harmless and friendly way. Right now, catching bees is not an easy task and it takes quite some time.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is describing the process of building the prototype. This will be done according to the design thinking model (figure ).</p>

</figure>
<p>In this model, the first step is to empathize with the stakeholders to really understand the problem. Here, the main problem is that capturing bees without a designated device is a time-consuming experience. Also, it requires some skills and catching bees should be made easy.</p>
<p>The next phase is the define-phase. In this phase, requirements are defined and wishes of the stakeholders will be considered. These requirements are shown in the next section.</p>
<p>Then, the ideate-phase can start in which ideas will be generated. Afterwards, we will build the prototype. And of course at last, we will validate the prototype. These phases will happen iteratively, until the stakeholders are satisfied with the results.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Before we can think of building the device, it is useful to know what requirements the device has to meet. The requirements are shown in figure .</p>

<h2 id="first-prototype">First prototype</h2>
<p>Within the ideate-phase of the design-thinking process, we searched for solutions which are already made. We found that insects used for research purposes are often caught with aspirators. This is a little device which uses a filter and small manual pump to suck insects in the filter. This is useful when you want to catch small amount of insects and little insects like ants. For bees, this is less useful. After a while, we found an article<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which described the process of building an aspirator which uses a vacuum cleaner instead of the manual pump. This was made to catch mosquitos, but we saw opportunities to use the same principles to build our prototype. We weren’t sure how the device exactly would function so we decided to validate the idea first.</p>
<p>A common approach for designing a user interface is creating a paper protype. Using paper, components can be easily changed and moved into other positions. For us, we just wanted to understand the device from the article more and had some empty toilet paper rolls to try it out. The first prototype is shown in figure .</p>

</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t a functional prototype since the paper was too weak for the vacuum cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="second-prototype">Second prototype</h2>
<p>Because we still don’t have any agreements about the financial side of the prototype, we can only use materials which we can find in our homes. Since the paper was too weak, we opted for something stronger. In the end a few stronger plastic bottles (they contained unpasteurized kombucha) were used. This prototype is the first prototype that worked with the normal vacuum cleaner, but also the smaller one (kruimeldief). Since, we didn’t have a lot of materials at home, we had to make some concessions. For instance, the tube which is used for catching the bees was too small. The second prototype is shown in figure .</p>

<h2 id="third-prototype">Third prototype</h2>
<p>After showing the last prototypes and showing our ideas, we made agreements about the financials. So this time, we could upgrade the prototype. We used PVC like the researchers in the article, but made a few adjustments here and there. We kept the idea of the bottle as the container, because of the availability and ease of use. The third prototype is shown in figure .</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="fourth-prototype">Fourth prototype</h2>
<p>This time, we upgraded the tube, so in the future bumblebees can also be caught. We also made the device portable by using the engine of the small vacuum cleaner which we bought. The fourth prototype is shown in figure .</p>

<h2 id="fifth-prototype">Fifth prototype</h2>
<p>This is an extra iteration on the last prototype the fix the battery and switch in place. We used PVC as the fixture and attached it the the body using a tube and glue. This worked suprisingly well. The prototype is shown in figure .</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>On 28-12-2020, we went to “Het Bijenhuis” in Wageningen to test our latest prototype. At first, the idea was to catch the bees outside in front of the hives, but the shop owner thought it would be very difficult and showed us the demonstration hive inside the shop. With the help of the demonstration hive, visitors can see the bees in action and because of its size and transparency, it was also ideal to test our prototype. The shop owner removed the bottom of the demonstration hive to create an opening for our device.</p>
<p>Once inserted, we started trying to catch the bees. The first attempt was not too promising. It looked like our device completely lost suction power. We couldn’t catch any bees. Fortunately, Sietse spotted that the container of the prototype (the bottle) was not fully inserted and air was leaking from the gaps. After reattaching the bottle, we tried again. This time, we succesfully could catch the bees! On the glass, where the tube of our device could completely “trap” the bees, it worked well. Attempts to catch the bees in the air sometimes worked well, but other times it looked like the suction power was to little. When the bees could grap onto something, it was impossible to catch them. The device just doesn’t have enough suction power for this.</p>
<p>In figure , the process of catching bees with our prototype is shown.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>During this project, a functional BeeCatcher prototype has been delivered, which is able to catch bees in a harmless and friendly way. This prototype is made from easy to find materials and can be considered cheap to build. However, the current prototype is not robust enough. In certain situations, bees can not be succesfully caught. This is due to the weak power of the current engine.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Our recommendation is to find a more powerful engine, and make this engine adjustable so bees can be caught in a harmless and friendly way in all conditions.</p>
<p>Since the prototype is made from easy to find materials, it is not yet scalable and mass-producible. Therefore, we recommend to convert the current design to a printable design. Our current knowledge is not yet sufficient to do this by ourselves.</p>
